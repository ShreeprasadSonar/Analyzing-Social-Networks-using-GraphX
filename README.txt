Brief steps:
1.Running the Code:
•	Configure the input_dataset_path variable in the notebook to specify the location of the soc-Epinions1.txt dataset file.
•	Execute the notebook's code cells in sequence to load the dataset, perform graph analysis using PySpark and GraphFrames, and derive insights.
•	The code generates various analysis results.
2.Interpreting the Results:
•	The notebook code generates results displaying top nodes based on various metrics such as outdegree, indegree, PageRank, connected components, and triangle counts within the Epinions social network dataset.
•	Analyze these results to understand influential nodes, network connectivity, and important structural aspects of the social network, facilitating insights into its dynamics and characteristics.
•	The combined output of these analyses is saved in the file named 'combined_output.txt' using the output_file_path variable. This file consolidates results for easy reference and comparison.
The notebook file (A3Q2.ipynb) with the code and results, including the consolidated 'combined_output.txt' file, is uploaded and can be accessed directly via this Google Drive link: A3Q2.ipynb - Google Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1a0HnLU2EEwIi_KWRIuNgwAcfFSyLoK6P?usp=sharing). Adjust the input_dataset_path variable within the notebook and run the cells sequentially to perform the analysis on the Epinions dataset, enabling the exploration of network properties and node significance.
